Copy over dashboard from the previous task into a task_1 directory at the root of the project

Modify src/schema/notifications.js to set up a schema using Normalizr

You’re going to use schema.Entity to create a 3 of entities.

The first one is an example the task will provide for you.

const user = new schema.Entity("users")

Create a message entity in a variable called message whose key is messages and set the idAttribute to the string guid in the options
Create a notification entity in a variable called notification whose key is notifications and set the definition of the entity as so:
author: user
context: message
Add a test in schema/notifications.test.js to verify that your normalized data has a correct result array. It should contain:

  "5debd76480edafc8af244228"
  "5debd764507712e7a1307303"
  "5debd76444dd4dafea89d53b"
  "5debd76485ee4dfd1284f97b"
  "5debd7644e561e022d66e61a"
  "5debd7644aaed86c97bf9d5e"
  "5debd76413f0d5e5429c28a0"
  "5debd7642e815cd350407777"
  "5debd764c1127bc5a490a4d0"
  "5debd7646ef31e0861ec1cab"
  "5debd764a4f11eabef05a81d"
  "5debd764af0fdd1fc815ad9b"
  "5debd76468cb5b277fd125f4"
  "5debd764de9fa684468cdc0b"
Add a test to verify that your normalized data has a correct users entity. Test to access the user with the id 5debd764a7c57c7839d722e9. It should return:

      age: 25,
      email: "poole.sanders@holberton.nz",
      id: "5debd764a7c57c7839d722e9",
      name: { first: "Poole", last: "Sanders" },
      picture: "http://placehold.it/32x32"
Add a test to verify that your normalized data has a correct messages entity. Test to access the message with the guid efb6c485-00f7-4fdf-97cc-5e12d14d6c41. It should return:

      guid: "efb6c485-00f7-4fdf-97cc-5e12d14d6c41",
      isRead: false,
      type: "default",
      value: "Cursus risus at ultrices mi."
Add a test to verify that your normalized data has a correct notifications entity. Test to access the notification with the id 5debd7642e815cd350407777. It should return:

      author: "5debd764f8452ef92346c772",
      context: "3068c575-d619-40af-bf12-dece1ee18dd3",
      id: "5debd7642e815cd350407777"
Tips:

The expected goal is to obtain a very easy to use dataset
If you are having undefined issues, look at idAttribute from the Normalizr documentation
Requirements:

You must export the list of notifications using a Normalizr’s normalize
All the tests in the project should pass
