Reuse the latest dashboard project you worked on in the React course 0x06-React_state

For this task, place notifications.json into the root of the project directory and use the data inside for the next step.

Create a new notifications.js file in a schema folder:

Import the JSON data from notifications.json and give it a name. Try import * as [variable name] from [path to notifications.json]
Create a function named getAllNotificationsByUser that accepts userId as an argument
The function should return a list containing all the context objects from the notifications.json data when the author id is the same as the userId
In the same schema directory, create a notifications.test.js file:

Add a test that uses the id 5debd764a7c57c7839d722e9 and verifies that the following data is returned:
[
  {
    guid: "2d8e40be-1c78-4de0-afc9-fcc147afd4d2",
    isRead: true,
    type: "urgent",
    value:
      "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt."
  },
  {
    guid: "280913fe-38dd-4abd-8ab6-acdb4105f922",
    isRead: false,
    type: "urgent",
    value:
      "Non diam phasellus vestibulum lorem sed risus ultricies. Tellus mauris a diam maecenas sed"
  }
]
Tips:

You can easily import JSON data using Babel
When writing your test, you can use the arrayContaining method from Jest to easily compare what the function returns and what you are expecting
Requirements:

You can use any loop function to go through the array
All the tests in the project should pass
