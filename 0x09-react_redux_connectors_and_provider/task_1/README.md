3. Update mapStateToProps
mandatory
In the App.js file:

Update the mapStateToProps function to also pass to the component the value for displayDrawer. It should be connected to the Reducer attribute isNotificationDrawerVisible
Update the render function of the component to use the value displayDrawer coming from the props instead of the state

In the App.js file:

Connect to the component the actions creators displayNotificationDrawer and hideNotificationDrawer
You should use the simplified version for the mapDispatchToProps. No need to import bindActionCreators
Modify the render function of the component to use the functions passed within the props instead of the action within the Class compon

In the App.js file:

You can delete the old function handleDisplayDrawer
You can delete the old function handleHideDrawer
Remove any state property related to the display of the drawer
Remove any binding in the constructor
You are now passing to your components props. You need to define propTypes and defaultProps


You can now refactor the App.test.js file:

You donâ€™t need to test the functions handleDisplayDrawer and handleHideDrawer since everything is already tested using the Redux mechanism
You need to update the test you previously created to support the new attribute
Tips:

At this point your app should be functional and able to display/hide the drawer using the Redux state
Remember that the state of uiReducer is using Map from Immutable
